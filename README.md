## Example Playbook

```
    - hosts: localhost
      roles:
        - dev-sec.windows-hardening
```

## Local Testing

For all our tests we use `test-kitchen`. If you are not familiar with `test-kitchen` please have a look at [their guide](http://kitchen.ci/docs/getting-started).

We create multiple hosts - one linux host where Ansible runs on and the Windows hosts.

Next install test-kitchen:

```bash
# Install dependencies
gem install bundler
bundle install
```

Then you can run the playbook and tests:
```
# create the ansible and windows hosts
bundle exec kitchen create

# run ansible playbook on windows host
bundle exec kitchen converge default-ansibleserver

# verify windows machines
bundle exec kitchen verify windows

```
